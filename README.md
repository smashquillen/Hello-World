# Hello-World
Brand new to coding - Test
I'm trying to change my career.  I'm good at tedius tasks but am also creative so I figured becoming some form of a developer would be a right fit for me.  I am starting school December 1st with a degree in Information Technology.  I chose that degree because it touches base on a number of IT fields.  I'm a bit nervous I won't like coding and want something to fall back on.
